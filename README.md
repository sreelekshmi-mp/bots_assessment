Testing Flutter Applications

## Don't forget to test your Dart Code

Testing is one of the most important things during the software development.

One of the beauty of the Dart Ecosystem, is the way developers can easily test their code.

Flutter has 3 types of tests.

- Unit tests are the one used for testing a method, or class.
- Widget tests are the tests for controlling single widget.
- Integration tests are tests the large scale or all of the application.

## Purpose

Through a flutter movie application, this repository is the code source of my [codelab](https://codelabs-bwnyasse-net.web.app/flutter_testing_tutorial.html#0) that provides a step by step approach for testing your flutter application.
